\format{\code{\link{R6Class}} object.}
\usage{
IndivCtstm
}
\description{
Simulate outcomes from an individual-level continuous time state transition model (CTSTM). The class is currently only valid for semi-Markov (i.e., "clock-reset") models; however,
functionality will soon be added for Markov  (i.e., "clock-forward") models.

\section{Methods}{

\describe{

\item{\code{new(trans_model = NULL, disprog = NULL, utility_model = NULL, cost_models = NULL)}}{

  Constructor for the class. \code{trans_model} must be specified in order to simulate disease progression with \code{sim_disease}. However, if an object of class "indiv_ctstm_disprog" has already been simulated using \code{\link{IndivCtstmTrans}}, then \code{disprog_} can be initialized using \code{disprog}.  
  
}
  
  \item{\code{sim_disease(max_t = 100, max_age = 100)}}{
    Simulate disease progression.
    
   \itemize{
     \item \code{max_t}: Maximum number of time periods to simulate the model.
    \item \code{max_age}: Maximum age to simulate each patient until. Default is 100.
   }
     
    Returns an instance of self with simulated output stored in \code{disprog_}. 
  }
  
  \item{\code{sim_stateprobs(t)}}{
    Simulate the probability of being in each health state as a function of time using the simulation output stored in \code{disprog_}.
    
     \itemize{
     \item \code{t}: A numeric vector of times.
     }
     
    Returns an instance of self with simulated output stored in \code{stateprobs_}.  
  }
  
  \item{\code{sim_qalys(dr = .03, type = c("predict", "random"), by_patient = FALSE)}}{
    Compute simulated (mean discounted) QALYs using the simulation output stored in \code{disprog_} by random sample from the PSA, treatment strategy, health state, and 
    (optionally) patient.
    
     \itemize{
     \item \code{dr}: Discount rate to apply to QALYs. May be a vector in which case QALYs are calculated for each element in \code{dr}.
     \item \code{type}: \code{predict} for mean values or \code{random} for random samples as in \code{$sim()} in \code{\link{StateVals}}.
     \item \code{by_patient}: If \code{TRUE}, QALYs are computed at the patient level. If \code{FALSE}, QALYs are averaged across patients by
     health state.
     }
     
     Returns an instance of self with simulated output stored in \code{qalys_}.
  } 
  
  \item{\code{sim_costs(dr = .03, type = c("predict", "random"), by_patient = FALSE, max_t = Inf)}}{
    Compute simulated (mean discounted) costs using the simulation output stored in \code{disprog_} by random sample from the PSA, treatment strategy, health state, and 
    (optionally) patient.
    
     \itemize{
     \item \code{dr}: Discount rate to apply to costs. May be a vector in which case costs are calculated for each element in \code{dr}.
      \item \code{type}: \code{predict} for mean values or \code{random} for random samples as in \code{$sim()} in \code{\link{StateVals}}.
     \item \code{by_patient}: If \code{TRUE}, costs are computed at the patient level. If \code{FALSE}, costs are averaged across patients by
     health state.      
      \item \code{max_t}: Maximum time duration to compute costs once a patient has entered a (new) health state. By default, equal to \code{Inf}, 
      so that costs are computed over the entire duration that a patient is in a given health state. If time varies by each cost category, then time can also be passed
      as a numeric vector of length equal to the number of cost categories (e.g., \code{c(1, 2, Inf, 3)} for a model with 4 cost categories).
     }
     
    Returns an instance of self with simulated output stored in \code{costs_}. 
  },
  
  \item{\code{summarize()}}{
    Produce a summary measure of costs and QALYs by random sample from the PSA and treatment strategy.
     
     Returns an object of summary cost-effectiveness output of class \code{\link{ce}}.
